# üõí Build New Mart Website Using Microfrontend Architecture

## üìã Project Overview

### Project Name: 
**Build New Mart Website Using Microfrontend Architecture**

### Project Description:
This project leverages a **microfrontend architecture** to seamlessly integrate **React** with **LitElement**. It features a product display component that retrieves and showcases products from an external API, allowing users to filter products by category. Additionally, the integration includes a search bar component, enhancing user interaction and streamlining the search process. The project also incorporates a **login process** to manage user authentication. By combining these technologies, the project aims to deliver an improved user experience through a more responsive and dynamic interface.

## üéØ Project Goals

### Primary Objectives:
- **Integration of React and Lit Components:**
  - Develop a web application that seamlessly integrates **React.js** and **Lit components** within a single HTML page.
  - Ensure smooth interaction and communication between the React and Lit components.
  
- **Component Functionality:**
  - Implement a **search-product** Lit component to provide search functionality for filtering products.
  - Develop a React component to display a list of products and handle user interactions.
  
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize the performance of the combined React and Lit components to ensure fast load times and efficient rendering.
  
- **User Experience:**
  - Design a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.
  - Ensure that the integration does not adversely affect usability or accessibility.
  
- **Security and Robustness:**
  - Implement security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.
  - Ensure the robustness and reliability of the integrated components.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Target Audience

- **End Users:** 
  - General public users of the Mart website.
- **Developers:** 
  - Those interested in modern frontend technologies and microfrontend architecture.
- **Product Managers:** 
  - Professionals seeking to improve the user experience and functionality of e-commerce platforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Design

### Architecture
**Microfrontend Architecture:**
- **Module Federation**
- **Deployment Strategy:** Shared Hosting

### Integration Approach

**Integration Method:**
- **Web Components:**
  - Microfrontend components are built as web components (using standards like Custom Elements) and then integrated into the main application.
  
- **Client-Side Routing:**
  - Microfrontends are integrated on the client side, with a router managing the display of different microfrontend components based on the URL. Each microfrontend is responsible for its own routing.

### Integration Points:
- **Navigation:** 
  - React Root (`<div id="root"></div>`): This div serves as the root element where the React application will be rendered.
  
- **Data Sharing:** 
  - Data Passing Between React and Lit: The integration between the React and Lit components may require data sharing. 

### Integration Challenges:
- **Script Loading Order**
- **Performance Issues**
- **Shared State Management**
- **JavaScript Conflicts**
- **Complex Testing Scenarios**
- **Version Conflicts**
- **Uniform Experience**
